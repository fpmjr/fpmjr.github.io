		<h1 class="heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<div class="container"> 
			<h4>What Time should I Arrive?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">We encourage you to arrive at 9:30 AM as the entourage starts to line up at this time. Processional will start at exactly 10 AM and this will be strictly followed. It is much appreciated to see all while we are having our first walk down the aisle.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>How do I get to the ceremony?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">For our guests who will be bringing their own car, you may use Waze/Google maps and just search for "National Shrine of Our Lady of Mount Carmel New Manila." You can also Grab your way to the venue and pin the said church. Better to allot an hour or two if you will be coming from North, South, East and West as this should already give you enough travel time given the "December Rush" traffic conditions. Anyway, event's on a Saturday, so traffic in the area should be fine.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Is there a parking area for our car?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">YES! There is a free parking area within National Shrine of Our Lady of Mount Carmel grounds. The reception area is just at the back of the church so no more worries of travelling again. No need to move your car. Yehay!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Can I invite a +1 / bring my kids / yaya / driver to your event?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">No. Unless we have personally confirmed this. As much as we want to accomodate all our friends and family, we halve limited number of seats available. Unfortunately, those who will come unexpected will not find their name in our seating arrangement. Thank you for understanding.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>What should I wear?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">Attire: Semi-formal</p>
			<p class="faqs">Gents: Collared long sleeves (in maroon / pink)</p>
			<p class="faqs">Ladies: Cocktail dress / long dress / dressy separates (in muted burgundy / light pink shades)</p>
			<p class="faqs">We hope our wedding will be a fun excuse to dress up and be fab! No casual attires please.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>I already confirmed yes to the RSVP however I cannot attend anymore due to an unforeseen event. What will I do?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">It would be sad for us that you can no longer attend our wedding event as we have specifically invited those who are close to our hearts. However, please do let us know as soon as possible so we can still give your allotted seat to other guest/s.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>I initially said no to the RSVP but had a change of plans - I can attend now. What will I do?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">We already took your NO as a final confirmation. Please understand that we have already allotted the seat to other guest/s the minute you declined the invitation. We can meet some other time to catch up after the wedding. Dinner maybe?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Can I sit anywhere at the reception?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">No. It took us a lot of effort to finish the seating arrangement which is planned for everyone's convenience, network preference and group familiarity so no need to worry. Our coordinators will gladly assist you in finding your designated seats.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Do you have any gift preferences?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">As love is what the day is all about, your presence is one we can't celebrate without. But should you still believe that a gift is worth giving, a small envelope for our future is a delightful blessing.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Am I allowed to take pictures / videos during the ceremony?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">As we walk down the aisle, we wish to see your faces and the joyful sight of your smiles. As such, we would want to keep the solemnity of the ceremony without any distractions coming from mobile phones that may be blocking the view. Photos will forever immortalize our wedding day so we hired professionals to capture the most important moments. Let us have them do their amazing jobs on their own (plus they are expensive). Don't worry, you can take all the photos you want, after the ceremony and during the reception.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Who do we get in touch with if we are unable to contact you on the wedding day?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">Please understand that we may not be able to answer you during the day since we'll be busy preparing already. If there are any urgent concerns, please contact our wedding coordinater, Ms. Anonymous Name of Anonymous Management at 09168711221</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>When is the appropriate time to leave?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">It took us a year to plan a wedding that everyone would hopefully enjoy. We aim to end the program at around X:XX XM, but we have the venue until XX PM so there will still be drinks and dancing after. PLEASE DON'T EAT AND RUN! :) If you must leave early, we'd love to thank you and say goodbye before you go, maybe not while our SAME DAY EDIT video is playing through.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>How can we help the couple make their most special day as memorable and wonderful as possible?</h4>
			<p class="faqs">Show up. Wear appropriate attire. Be there on time. Stay until the end of the program. And most espicially ENJOY!</p>
